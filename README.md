   - `Name` (string): The name of the country.  
   - `Population` (int): The population of the country.  
2. **Create a collection** of `Country` objects, where each object represents a country with its respective population.  
3. **Sort** the collection of countries in descending order based on their population.  
4. **Display** the sorted list of countries in the format:  
   - `Country: [Country Name] Population: [Population]`  
   - The population should be displayed with thousand separators for better readability.
